## MyWork
This repository is being maintained to showcase the work that I have done. 

The work is divided in folders as below:

##### Algorithms : 
This folder will have all the algorithms implemented using pre-built modules in Python. There will be no external library used.

If you are visting this repository, I would love to have feedbacks. Please share your thoughts.

##### The upcoming codes:

1. Encoder-Decoder model with multiple datasets
2. Generate Perturbed images using IBM ART toolkit and detect and mitigate the Adversarial noise using different techniques
3. Transfer Learning
4. Regularization techniques on Deep learning models
5. Grid World problem using the Re-inforcement Learning (Q-learning)
6. Multi-layer implementation without using any library.
7. Defense-GAN: Protecting Classifiers Against Adversarial Attacks Using Generative Models Implemented.
8. Emotional Chatting Machine:
9. CAM Analysis
10. BERT models
